description: Find archived messages by words, meaning, account, conversation, or message type.
---

Use `msgvault search` to find archived email, chats, calendar events, and
meeting transcripts. Keyword search works without an embedding provider.
Combine words with filters to narrow the result, then use `msgvault show-message <id>`
to read a message.

| What you want to find | Where to search |
|---|---|
| Words in a message or its subject | `msgvault search "quarterly report"` |
| A topic, even with different wording | [Vector or hybrid message search](/docs/usage/vector-search/) |
| Words or topics inside an attached document | [Document attachment search](/docs/usage/document-indexing/#search-and-inspect-status) |
| An image or video by its visual content | [Visual attachment search](/docs/usage/vector-search/#visual-attachment-search) |
| A person by their curated profile | [Semantic person search](/docs/usage/people/#find-a-person-by-what-you-remember) |

Message search does not search extracted document text or attachment pixels.
Those have separate indexes and setup steps.

## Basic Usage

```bash
msgvault search <query>
```

!!! note
    The full-text search index (FTS5) is populated automatically during sync.
    If an older archive needs an index backfill, msgvault checks and rebuilds
    the index in the background. Search uses the current index and warns about
    incomplete results only for a known gap or rebuild, including a queued
    rebuild. A completeness check alone stays quiet. See the
    [CLI reference](../cli-reference.md#search) for details.

## Search Operators

msgvault supports a local subset of Gmail-like search syntax.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `from:` | Sender address | `from:alice@example.com` |
| `to:` | Recipient address | `to:bob@example.com` |
| `cc:` | CC recipient | `cc:team@example.com` |
| `bcc:` | BCC recipient | `bcc:admin@example.com` |
| `subject:` | Subject text | `subject:meeting` |
| `label:` | Gmail label | `label:INBOX`, `label:SENT` |
| `list:` / `list-id:` | RFC 2919 List-Id literal substring | `list:announce.example.org` |
| `received:` | Exact address that received inbound mail | `received:work@example.org` |
| `account:` | Exact account of received mail, sent mail, or a calendar event | `account:work@example.org` |
| `has:attachment` | Has attachments | `has:attachment` |
| `before:` | Before date | `before:2024-06-01` |
| `after:` | After date | `after:2024-01-01` |
| `older_than:` | Relative date | `older_than:7d`, `2w`, `1m`, `1y` |
| `newer_than:` | Relative date | `newer_than:30d` |
| `larger:` | Minimum size | `larger:5M`, `100K` |
| `smaller:` | Maximum size | `smaller:1M` |
| `message_type:` | Stored message type | `message_type:teams`, `message_type=calendar_event` |
| `conversation_id:` | Local conversation ID | `conversation_id:123` |

Bare words and `"quoted phrases"` perform full-text search across message subjects and bodies.

List-Id matching is case-insensitive and treats `%`, `_`, and `\` literally.
Quote a value when it contains spaces, for example
`list-id:"Example Announcements"`. Repeating `list:` or `list-id:` uses AND
semantics: every supplied substring must occur in the stored List-Id.

### Find mail by the address that received it

Several confirmed addresses can deliver into one archive source, for example
work@ forwarding into a personal Gmail. `received:work@example.org` finds
inbound mail that address received, including forwarded mail whose visible To
shows a list or Bcc. `account:work@example.org` also finds sent mail from that
address and calendar events of that calendar.

- Confirm the address for its source first (`msgvault identity add` or identity
  discovery). Both operators take one exact address; case is ignored, dots and
  plus suffixes are not.
- msgvault picks one account per message from its delivery headers, then its
  confirmed To/Cc recipients, then the source's own mailbox. When two confirmed
  addresses tie, the message has no account and neither operator finds it.
- `received:` excludes sent copies, drafts and calendar events. A message
  counts as sent only when the provider filed it under Sent or Drafts.
- `--account` selects a whole archive source. `account:` matches only messages
  attributed to the address, so mail forwarded into a personal source matches
  `account:work@example.org` but not `--account work@example.org`.
- Repeating one operator matches any of the values; using both requires both.
- Mail archived by an older version fills in on the source's next sync, or
  right away with [`msgvault repair-derived`](../cli-reference.md#repair-derived).
- `--mode=vector` and `--mode=hybrid` reject both operators; use `--mode=fts`.

Delivery headers are routing hints, not proof that you own an address, and
attribution never lets msgvault send from it. The
[design record](https://github.com/kenn-io/msgvault/blob/main/docs/internal/received-as-identity-design.md) lists the headers
and the order msgvault trusts them in.

### Domain Search

The `from:`, `to:`, `cc:`, and `bcc:` operators recognize bare domain names with common TLDs. For example, `from:example.com` automatically matches all messages from the `example.com` domain. For uncommon TLDs, use the explicit `@` prefix: `from:@brand.pizza`.

## Examples

```bash
# Search by sender
msgvault search from:alice@example.com

# Search by domain (bare domain with common TLD)
msgvault search from:example.com

# Uncommon TLD requires explicit @ prefix
msgvault search "from:@brand.pizza"

# Subject search
msgvault search subject:meeting

# Date range
msgvault search "after:2024-01-01 before:2024-06-01"

# Messages with attachments
msgvault search has:attachment

# By label
msgvault search label:INBOX

# By mailing list (both aliases are equivalent)
msgvault search 'list:"<announce.example.org>"'
msgvault search 'list-id:announce list-id:example.org'

# Combined filters
msgvault search "from:boss@company.com has:attachment after:2024-01-01"

# Full-text search
msgvault search "quarterly report"

# Search within one archived conversation
msgvault search "conversation_id:123 budget"
```

`conversation_id:` takes the positive local conversation ID shown in message
metadata, not the provider's thread or room ID. It works with keyword, vector,
and hybrid search. Vector and hybrid queries still need free text.

## Repairing Existing Archives

Fresh email ingest indexes `List-Id` automatically. For messages archived by
an older msgvault version, preview the offline backfill first, then apply it:

```bash
msgvault repair-list-ids
msgvault repair-list-ids --apply
```

The default dry run reports what would change without modifying the archive.
`--apply` writes the repaired values from stored raw MIME and marks derived
analytics stale for the normal rebuild path; neither mode contacts the provider.

## Account and Collection Filters

In multi-account archives, use `--account` to limit results to a specific account, or `--collection` to search every member account in a named collection:

```bash
msgvault search "quarterly report" --account work@company.com
msgvault search "quarterly report" --collection Work

# List all messages for an account or collection (no search query needed)
msgvault search --account work@company.com
msgvault search --collection Work
```

The two flags are mutually exclusive. Collection filters work in full-text, vector, and hybrid local search modes.

SQLite FTS ranking is weighted to better match PostgreSQL-backed search behavior, so subject/body weighting should feel more consistent across local tools. The rankers are still different; see [Search Ranking Across Backends](/docs/architecture/search-ranking/).

## Source-Deleted Messages

Search excludes messages deleted from their source account by default. Full-text
search can select that retained local history explicitly:

```bash
# Only messages deleted from their source account
msgvault search "quarterly report" --deletion-scope deleted

# Active and source-deleted messages
msgvault search "quarterly report" --deletion-scope any
```

The accepted values are `active` (the default), `deleted`, and `any`. This scope
applies to source deletion (`deleted_from_source_at`); rows hidden internally by
deduplication are never returned. It is available only with `--mode fts` because
the vector index intentionally covers active messages only. Vector and hybrid
search reject non-active deletion scopes instead of returning incomplete results.

Gmail incremental sync records History API deletion events. When the saved
history cursor has expired, msgvault reconciles deletion metadata only after an
unfiltered, unlimited snapshot of the complete mailbox succeeds. A regular
`sync-full` result, including one narrowed by a query, limit, or date range, is
not treated as proof that omitted messages were deleted. In either path, the
archive retains the message and raw MIME data; only its source-presence metadata
changes.

HTTP clients can pass the same values as `deletion_scope` on
`GET /api/v1/cli/search`.

## Filtering by Message Type

Archives can hold more than email — Google Calendar events, Microsoft Teams
and Discord messages, text messages, calls, voicemails, and Messenger imports
all live in the same database. Restrict a search to one or more kinds with the
`message_type:` operator or the repeatable/comma-separated `--message-type`
flag:

```bash
# Only Google Calendar events
msgvault search "standup" --message-type calendar_event

# Only Microsoft Teams messages
msgvault search "message_type:teams incident review"

# Only Discord guild messages
msgvault search "release planning" --message-type discord

# Only SMS/MMS text messages
msgvault search "dinner" --message-type sms --message-type mms
```

Valid values are `email`, `google_chat`, `calendar_event`, `meeting_transcript`,
`beeper`, `sms`, `mms`, `rcs`, `whatsapp`, `imessage`, `teams`, `discord`, `slack`, `fbmessenger`,
`synctech_sms_call`, `google_voice_text`, `google_voice_call`, and
`google_voice_voicemail`. `message_type:email` also includes legacy rows whose
type is empty because older msgvault versions created them before the column
existed.

The same message-type scoping is available in HTTP search via the
`message_type` query parameter. In MCP, include a `message_type:` operator in
the `search_metadata`, `search_message_bodies`, or
`semantic_search_messages` query; `find_similar_messages` accepts a
`message_type` parameter.

## JSON Output

Add `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
msgvault search from:alice@example.com --json
```

## Semantic / Hybrid Search

The same `msgvault search` command supports semantic search when the
selected local daemon or remote server has `[vector]` configured with
an embedding endpoint. Pass
`--mode vector` for pure semantic search, or `--mode hybrid` to fuse
BM25 and vector ranking. See [Vector Search](/docs/usage/vector-search/)
for setup, initial embedding, and incremental update workflows.
